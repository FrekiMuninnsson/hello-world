# hello-world
Just another first baby zygote of a repository.
I like Miyazaki films, blublockers, Hokusai prints, Spicy food, geek chic, music festivals, and making useful things that look nice.
I want to become a really good programmer, full stack developer, and multimedia creator for several reasons.
First, I love creating things.
Second, I love creating things that different kinds of people will find useful.
Third, I want to create opportunities for people who have made mistakes in their lives but have resolved to better themselves, like me.
Fourth, I want to create a professional space apart from and insulated from SJW authoritarians so that people can feel free to be and express themselves regardless of background. There will be no nebulous code of conduct to invade the personal lives of people in my organization.
Meritocracy is more important than anything else. People who earn their place in my organization will thrive, and people who expect special treatment due to race, religion, gender, sexuality, or any other immutable characteristic will be cast off.
Any program that I create after training will always have to meet the standards of having a clear answer to the following questions:
In what impactful way will this program positively affect the life of the person using it?
In what way could this program be abused and what steps have we taken to prevent such abuse?
